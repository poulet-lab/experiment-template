# Project Template

## Description

This template serves as a guide for maintaining a standardized folder structure within a project.

## Folder Structure
The project is organized into two main folders: `data` and `src`. <br>
Each folder contains a README file providing detailed explanations of their respective purposes.

## Gitignore

The template is language-agnostic but includes specific exceptions for Python and MATLAB in .gitignore file. <br>
It's crucial to update this file as necessary to exclude unnecessary files from being synced to GitHub.

For instance, common data files are excluded by default.
If there's a need to sync PNG format figures with GitHub, remove the `*.png` exclusion from .gitignore.
However, exercise caution to ensure that only required files are synced and unnecessary ones are omitted.

## Usage
Push `use as template` button to create a new repository based on this template.
Clone the repository and start developing there :)
